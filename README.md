# NexusAI Compliance Checker

**Building the Trust and Safety Layer for Generative AI.**

## 🚀 Vision

Our ambition is to become the **unbiased, foundational standard** for AIGC (AI-Generated Content) copyright compliance and safety—a public utility as essential as the generative models themselves.

We envision a future where every creator can generate content with confidence, free from the hidden legal risks of training data copyright infringement.

## 🚨 The Problem

The explosive growth of open-source AIGC models (Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI workflows, etc.) has created a legal gray area. Creators, from hobbyists to studios, unknowingly risk copyright violations because:

*   **"Safe" models are gatekept** behind corporate walls.
*   **Transparency is lacking** in training data sources.
*   **No open-source tool exists** to audit and mitigate this risk at scale.

We are building the **missing public good** for the AIGC ecosystem.

## 🛠️ Our Approach (Technical Framework)

This project will evolve through defined phases to de-risk the AIGC pipeline:

1.  **Phase 1: Compliance Scanning**
    *   Develop a scalable tool to scan AI-generated images against known copyrighted style fingerprints.
    *   Provide a risk assessment score for generated content.

2.  **Phase 2: "Clean" Model Marketplace**
    *   Curate and host a marketplace for models verified to be trained on legally compliant or licensed data.
    *   Empower creators to choose ethically-sourced generation tools.

3.  **Phase 3: Attribution & Arbitration**
    *   Explore blockchain-based attribution for AI-assisted works.
    *   Provide a pathway for copyright holders and creators to resolve disputes.
